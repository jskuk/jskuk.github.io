I am a political scientist focused on inequality, currently working as an Assistant Professor at the University of Oklahoma. I received my PhD in Political Science from University of California, San Diego in December 2017. 

I use new computational methods such as automated text analysis to study the political causes and consequences of economic, racial, and gender inequality. My primary research area examines how the housing rental market perpetuates residential segregation, how public policy reinforces racial and gender inequality, and how economic inequality deepens racial polarization. I am broadly interested in American politics, political behavior, race and ethnicity politics, urban politics, politics of inequality, voting rights, and computational social science. 

I am dedicated to understanding the consequences of American inequality and using political science to better inform solutions.
