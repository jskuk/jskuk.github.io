I am an assistant professor of 1855 in the department of political science at Michigan State University. 

My primary research area examines how the housing rental market perpetuates residential segregation, how public policy reinforces racial and gender inequality, and how economic inequality deepens racial polarization. I am broadly interested in American politics, political behavior, race and ethnicity politics, urban politics, politics of inequality, voting rights, and computational social science. 

I am dedicated to understanding the consequences of American inequality and using political science to better inform solutions.
